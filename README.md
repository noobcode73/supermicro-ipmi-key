# supermicro-ipmi-key

This is a script to easily generate keys for the supermicro IPMI interface, based on [the documentation published by Peter Kleissner](https://peterkleissner.com/2018/05/27/reverse-engineering-supermicro-ipmi/ "the documentation published by Peter Kleissner").


To generate a key, simply take the MAC address from the IPMI card (case doesnâ€™t matter), pass it as argument to the script, and paste the resulting key piece by piece into the activation web form:

    # python3 supermicro-ipmi-key.py AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
